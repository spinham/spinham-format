Workflow
========

Topical discussions are hosted via |issues|_.

Finalized discussion (either via consensus or vote) shall be summarized in the
:ref:`FDP document <fdp>`.

Any member can open an issue or propose an FDP.

What is an FDP?
===============

See :ref:`fdp-0` for the description of FDP concept and workflow.

Finalization of the design stage
================================

Once all proposed FDPs are resolved and all topical issues are closed, the call
for the end of the design stage (an open issue in this repository with a
notification to everyone) can be made by any member and if no new FDP appear
after XX>7 days after the call, then the work will move to the implementation
stage.
