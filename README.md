# Ongoing stage: Design

**Goal**: A set of format's design principles (FDPs)

**Desired duration**: two-three months

## Workflow

Topical discussions are hosted via [issues](https://github.com/spinham/spinham-format/issues).

Finalized discussion (either via consensus or vote) shall be summarized in the FDF document.

Any member can open an issue or propose an FDP.

## How to write an FDP

See [issue#9](https://github.com/spinham/spinham-format/issues/9)

## Finalisation of the design stage

Once all proposed FDPs and all topical issues are closed, the call for the end of the design stage (an open issue in this repository with a notification to everyone) can be made by any member and if no new FDP appear after XX>7 days after the call, then the work will move to the implementation stage.
